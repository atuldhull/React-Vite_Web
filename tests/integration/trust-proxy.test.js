/**
 * Tests that the Express app trusts the FIRST proxy hop in the
 * X-Forwarded-For chain — required for accurate per-IP rate-limiting
 * and for express-session's `secure` cookie to fire on HTTPS deploys.
 *
 * The setting lives in createApp() in app.js; here we boot the real
 * app and assert req.ip / req.protocol behaviour from the outside.
 *
 * Why bake this into a regression test rather than rely on a
 * one-line config: a future refactor that drops `app.set("trust
 * proxy", 1)` would silently revert every per-IP rate limit to "all
 * users share one bucket" — exactly the kind of regression that's
 * impossible to spot in code review without a test calling it out.
