## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (legacy-peer-deps needed for the Three.js + zustand overrides)
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# 2. Configure environment — copy the template and fill in real values
cp .env.example .env.local

# 3. Run both servers — backend on :3000, Vite dev server on :5173
npm run dev

# Individually, if you prefer two terminals:
npm run dev:server     # nodemon backend/server.js
npm run dev:frontend   # vite on :5173 with /api + /socket.io proxied

# Production build + serve
npm run build          # builds frontend -> public/app/
npm start              # node backend/server.js serves API + built SPA
```

Open **http://localhost:5173/app/** in dev, or **http://localhost:3000/** for the built
SPA served by Express.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | yes | Supabase project URL |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | yes | Supabase service role key (server-only) |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | yes | Random 32+ char string — used for express-session signing |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | prod | CORS allow-list origin in production |
| `SESSION_DB_URL` or `REDIS_URL` | prod | Postgres or Redis backing store for sessions |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | feature | Enables AI question generation + PANDA tutor |
| `CONTACT_EMAIL` / `CONTACT_APP_PASSWORD` | feature | Gmail + app password for contact form + invoice emails |
| `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` / `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` / `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | feature | Razorpay (for org subscriptions) |
| `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` / `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` / `VAPID_CONTACT` | feature | Web push notifications. Generate with `node backend/scripts/generateVapidKeys.js` |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | feature | Sentry error reporting (any free-tier DSN works) |
| `PORT` | no | Server port (default 3000) |

Missing a feature-gated var? Feature silently disables at boot with a warning log. Missing
a required var in production → process exits immediately with a clear error (see
`backend/config/env.js`).

## User Roles

```
super_admin > admin > teacher > student
```

Higher roles inherit every lower-role permission. Protection is enforced at three layers:
`ProtectedRoute` in the router, role-specific Express middleware on each `/api/*` route,
and database-level Row Level Security policies on every tenant table.

---

## Architecture

```
Client (React 19 SPA, Vite 7)
  │ HTTPS + WebSocket
  ▼
Express 5 server (:3000)
  ├── REST API (/api/*)
  ├── Socket.IO (quiz engine, chat relays, notifications, presence)
  ├── express-session with Postgres-backed store in production
  ├── Tenant middleware — auto-injects org_id into every Supabase query
  ├── Auth middleware — role-based route guards
  ├── CSRF middleware — double-submit cookie pattern (csrf-csrf)
  ├── Zod validation on every mutating request body
  ├── Pino structured logging with request-ID tagging (AsyncLocalStorage)
  └── Global error handler → pino + optional Sentry capture
        │
        ▼
  Supabase PostgreSQL
  ├── 20+ tables (students, orgs, challenges, events, messages, …)
  ├── Row Level Security: default-deny on every tenant table
  └── Service-role key for backend writes (service-role bypasses RLS by design)
```

---

## Database

All schema lives in `backend/migrations/` as hand-written, idempotent SQL
files, numbered in the order they must run. Each file is self-contained —
`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, etc.
— so re-running them is a safe no-op.

| File | What it establishes |
|------|---------------------|
| `01_base_tables.sql` | Core: `students`, `challenges`, `attempts`, `leaderboard_weekly_winners` |
| `02_extended_columns.sql` | Profile extras — title, avatar, streaks, XP |
| `03_events_site_settings.sql` | `events`, `event_registrations`, `site_settings` |
| `04_notifications_certificates.sql` | `notifications`, `certificate_batches`, `certificates` |
| `05_profile_avatar.sql` | `avatar_config` JSON + auto-colour |
| `06_features_orgs_plans.sql` | `organisations`, `subscription_plans`, `feature_flags` |
| `07_payment_subscriptions.sql` | Razorpay subscriptions + invoices |
| `08_messaging_friendships.sql` | `friendships`, `conversations`, `messages`, `user_public_keys` |
| `09_referral_system.sql` | Referral codes + attribution |
| `10_events_upgrade.sql` | Events v2 — capacity, cover_image, categories |
| `11_notification_types.sql` | Notification category enum + filters |
| `12_qr_checkin.sql` | Event QR check-in table |
| `13_push_subscriptions.sql` | Web-push subscription rows (VAPID) |
| `14_multitenant_org_columns.sql` | `org_id NOT NULL` across tenant tables |
| `16_session_store.sql` | Postgres-backed express-session table |
| `17_rls_policies.sql` | Row-level-security default-deny on tenant tables |
| `18_idempotency_keys.sql` | Idempotency for payment webhooks |
| `19_paid_events.sql` | UPI/QR manual payment flow |
| `20_profile_visibility.sql` | Per-user privacy tiers for profile pages |

### Applying migrations

Supabase doesn't ship a CLI migration runner by default. Two ways to apply:

1. **Supabase SQL Editor (easiest):** dashboard → **SQL Editor** → paste the
   contents of each file in order, click **Run**. Each file prints a trailing
   `SELECT` that shows row counts so you can sanity-check the apply worked.
2. **psql:** `psql "$SESSION_DB_URL" -f backend/migrations/01_base_tables.sql`
   (and so on).

The order matters — later files reference columns/tables added by earlier ones.

### Row Level Security

Every tenant table has RLS enabled + a default-deny policy (`17_rls_policies.sql`).
Backend writes bypass RLS via the service-role key; the frontend never talks
to Supabase directly, so no RLS policies need to account for unauthenticated
reads. If you're extending the schema, add the same pattern:

```sql
ALTER TABLE your_new_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "default_deny" ON your_new_table FOR ALL USING (false);
```

### Seeding dev data

No automated seed exists — if you want sample content for local
development, create an organisation + students via the SQL editor or the
admin UI after logging in for the first time.

## Scripts

```bash
npm start              # Production server — node backend/server.js
npm run dev            # concurrently — backend (nodemon) + frontend (vite)
npm run build          # Production frontend build → public/app/
npm run lint           # ESLint check
npm run typecheck      # TypeScript check (JSDoc + checkJs — no compile)
npm test               # Vitest run — 571 tests
npm run test:coverage  # Vitest with coverage gate (CI)
npm run e2e            # Playwright E2E smoke tests
```

---

## Testing

**571 tests across 54 files**:

| Layer | What it covers |
|-------|----------------|
| **Unit** | Pure logic — roles, feature flags, crypto primitives, mnemonic/sigil derivation, relationship state helpers, arena scoring |
| **Integration** | Express routes via `supertest` — auth, payment, messaging, chat settings, relationship endpoints, profile aggregation, paid events |
| **Component (jsdom)** | React components with mocked stores — FriendButton state machine, MessageButton, ProfileTabs, tab content, IdentityGlyph |
| **E2E (Playwright)** | 7 browser-level smoke tests against a production build — health probes, CSRF, SPA shell, security headers |

Coverage thresholds enforced in `vitest.config.js` (55 / 45 / 55 / 55 baseline, actual
numbers consistently 10+ points above). Pre-commit hook runs lint + typecheck +
`test:coverage` so regressions never reach `main`.

---

## CI / CD

GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

1. `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps`
2. `npm run lint`
3. `npm run typecheck`
4. `npm run test:coverage` (fails the job if coverage drops below threshold)
5. `npm run build`
6. `npx playwright install chromium --with-deps`
7. `npm run e2e`

Every push to `main` + every PR runs the full pipeline. Dependabot checks npm deps
weekly.

---

## Deployment

### Render (recommended — free tier)

1. **New Web Service** → connect your GitHub repo.
2. **Build command:** `npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build`
3. **Start command:** `npm start`
4. Add env vars from the table above.
5. First deploy takes 3–4 minutes. Hit `/api/health` to verify.

UptimeRobot pinging `/api/health` every 5 min keeps the free-tier dyno warm during
active hours.

### Other platforms

Any host that runs a persistent Node process + supports WebSockets works: Fly.io,
Railway, Oracle Cloud free VM. **Vercel does not** — the app needs a persistent Socket.IO
connection which serverless functions can't provide.

## Monument Theme System

Every page calls `useMonument('name')` + renders `<MonumentBackground monument="name" />`.
Eight themed biomes (desert, pyramid, glacier, jungle, city, abyss, sky, magma) each set
CSS variables `--page-accent`, `--page-glow`, `--org-primary`, `--org-secondary` so
buttons and cards automatically match the current scene.
